    <p>Matar paneer is a popular North Indian dish made with green peas (matar) and Indian cottage cheese (paneer) cooked in a rich tomato-based gravy. Here's a simple recipe for making matar paneer:</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <br>
    <h5>For the gravy:</h5>

    <ul><li>2 cups ripe tomatoes, roughly chopped</li></ul>
    <ul><li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li></ul>
    <ul><li>2-3 cloves of garlic, minced</li></ul>
    <ul><li>1-inch piece of ginger, grated</li></ul>
    <ul><li>1/2 cup cashews, soaked in hot water for 15-20 minutes</li></ul>
    <ul><li>2 tablespoons oil or ghee (clarified butter)</li></ul>
    <ul><li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li></ul>
    <ul><li>coriander </li></ul>
    <ul><li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li></ul>
    <ul><li>1 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)</li></ul>
    <ul><li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Salt to taste</li></ul>
    <ul><li>1/2 cup water</li></ul>

    <h3>
        For the peas and paneer:
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup fresh or frozen green peas (matar)</li>
        <li>250g paneer (cottage cheese), cut into cubes</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh cream (optional)</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro leaves, chopped, for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
        Instructions:
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> by making the tomato-cashew paste. In a blender, combine the chopped tomatoes, soaked cashews, grated ginger, and minced garlic. Blend until you get a smooth paste. Set this paste aside.</li>

        <li> Heat oil or ghee in a pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them sizzle for a few seconds.</li>
    
        <li> Add the finely chopped onions and saut√© until they become translucent and light brown.</li>
    
        <li>  Add the tomato-cashew paste and cook it over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the mixture thickens and the oil starts to separate from it. This can take around 10-15 minutes.</li>
    
        <li> Add the coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala, and salt. Mix well and cook for a few more minutes until the spices are well incorporated.</li>
    
        <li> Pour in 1/2 cup of water and let the gravy simmer for another 5-7 minutes. If the gravy is too thick, you can add a bit more water to achieve your desired consistency.</li>
    
        <li> Add the green peas (matar) and cook for about 5 minutes, or until they become tender.</li>
    
        <li> Gently add the paneer cubes and simmer for another 2-3 minutes. Be careful not to overcook the paneer, as it can become tough.</li>
    
        <li> If using fresh cream, add it at this stage and stir it into the gravy. This will give the dish a creamy texture.</li>
    
        <li> Garnish the matar paneer with freshly chopped cilantro leaves.</li>
    
        <li> Serve matar paneer hot with naan, roti, or steamed rice.</li>
    </ul>
