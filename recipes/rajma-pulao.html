    <p>Rajma pulao is a delicious and flavorful Indian dish made with kidney beans (rajma) and rice. Here's a simple recipe to make rajma pulao:</p>

    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <h5>For cooking the rice:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup basmati rice</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the rajma (kidney beans) mixture:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup cooked kidney beans (rajma)</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon oil or ghee (clarified butter)</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li> 1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste</li>
        <li>1-2 green chilies, finely chopped (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
        <li> Salt to taste</li>
        <li>>Fresh cilantro leaves, chopped, for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For garnishing:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fried onions (optional)</li>
        <li>Sliced cucumber and lemon wedges</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>         
            Wash the rice in cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for 30 minutes, then drain.</li>
        
            <li>In a large, heavy-bottomed pan, heat the oil or ghee over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds and let them sizzle for a few seconds.</li>
        
            <li> Add the chopped onions and sauté until they turn translucent and light brown.</li>
        
            <li> Add the ginger-garlic paste and chopped green chilies. Sauté for a couple of minutes until the raw aroma disappears.</li>
        
            <li>Stir in the chopped tomatoes and cook until they become soft and the oil starts to separate from the mixture.</li>
        
            <li>Add the red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, and salt. Mix well and cook for a few more minutes.</li>
        
            <li>Add the cooked kidney beans (rajma) and mix them with the spice mixture. Let them cook together for a few minutes.</li>
        
            <li>In a separate pot, bring 2 cups of water to a boil. Add the soaked and drained rice and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Cook the rice until it's about 70% done (slightly undercooked). Drain the rice and set it aside.</li>
        
            <li>Layer the partially cooked rice over the rajma mixture in the pan. Do not mix it, but spread it evenly.</li>
        
            <li>Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid and cook on low heat for about 15-20 minutes. You can also place a tava (griddle) under the pan to prevent direct contact with the flame.</li>
        
            <li>After 15-20 minutes, remove the pan from heat and let it rest for another 10 minutes without opening the lid. This allows the flavors to meld and the rice to finish cooking with the steam.</li>
        
            <li>Gently fluff the rajma pulao with a fork, and garnish it with chopped cilantro, fried onions (if desired), and serve it hot.</li>
        
            <li>Serve rajma pulao with sliced cucumber and lemon wedges on the side. It pairs well with raita or a simple salad.</li>
    </ul>
